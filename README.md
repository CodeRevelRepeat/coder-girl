## <a name="how-it-works" />How it Works

Coder Girls learn programming fundamentals through challenges of increasing difficulty. As they progress through challenges, users are awarded points, and top scorers are featured on an application-wide leaderboard. To create a fun and social experience, the leaderboard shows off users' Instagram feeds. As they code, users can turn to each other for support and joint problem solving through a live chatroom.

## <a name="motivation" />Motivation 

Girls make up only 19% of high school AP Computer Science test-takers, and only 12% of Computer Science degrees were earned by women at major research universities in recent years. This needs to change. We foster girls' interest in and confidence with coding at a young age. By doing so, we hope the representation of women holding computer-related occupations will increase.
