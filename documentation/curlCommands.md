curl -i -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title":"String Theory","instructions":"In JavaScript you can put any keyboard characters you want in quotes and you have created a \"string\".    The quotes can be single or double quotes but they have to match.  A string can be made up of a single letter,   a single word or whole paragraphs.  The sky is the limit.  In the editor, create a string that contains your favorite hashtag for selfies.  Note that in the editor, it now says \"//type your string here\".  By putting \"//\" before text, it turns the entire line into   a comment that is ignored by JavaScript.  It allows you to write comments about your code to remind your later self what you did.   So, make sure to write your brilliant new string on line 2.  Otherwise, if you write it on line 1 it will be ignored.","content":"//type your string on the next line","testCode":1,"pointValue":100,"hint1":"Did you place your string in matching quotes (either both single quotes or both double quotes)?","hint2":"My answer would be \"#filtersforever\"."}' http://localhost:3000/api/challenges/addChallenge
