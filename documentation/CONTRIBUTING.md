# Contributing

## General Workflow

1. Fork the repo
1. Cut a namespaced feature from master
    - bug/...
    - feat/...
    - test/...
    - doc/...
    - refactor/...
1. Make commits to your feature branch
  - (feat) Add a new feature
  - (fix) Fix inconsistent tests
  - (refactor) ...
  - (cleanup) ...
  - (test) ...
  - (doc) ...
1. When you've finished with your fix or feature, rebase changes from the project repo into your branch
1. Submit a [pull request][] directly to the master branch of the project
1. Your pull request will be reviewed by every member of the organization. 
1. Fix any issues raised by the code reviewers, and push your fixes as a new commit per issue
1. Once the pull request has been reviewed and approved, it will be merged by the scrum master
